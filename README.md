## Input data 
This folder consist of the input count and phenotype data for the analysis performed.

## Script 
This folder consist of the script endometrial_cancer_analysis.R that performs the following analysis:<br /> 

1.Cancer Stages Identification<br /> 
2.Cluster Analysis: Perform cluster analysis<br /> 
3.Differential Expression Analysis<br /> 
4.Visualization<br /> 
5.Target Gene Identification and Pathway Analysis<br /> 

## Results
This folder consist of the results which is obtained from the analysis performed by the script in the previous section. It consist of the PCA_plot and a table with stages of cancer and the number of samples in each stage.<br /> 

1.volcanoplots: This folder consist of the volcano plots which is created to visualize the DE analysis of the miRNA data for different cancer stages.<br /> 
2.go_enrichment: This folder consist of the GO enrichment results of the miRNA data after identifying the gene target for significant miRNA identified in the DE analysis stage.<br /> 
3.kegg_enrichment: This folder consist of the KEGG enrichment results of the miRNA data after identifying the gene target for significant miRNA identified in the DE analysis stage.<br />
